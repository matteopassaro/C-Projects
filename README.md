💻 C-Projects

📘 In this repository are stored some projects I did while learning C at University.
 
I want to improve my programming skills and understand better the C language.

To do so from time to time I will write some code, some of these will be very easy and basic projects, but I hope that in future they'll be more and more complex with the passing of the time. 

🧮 CALCULATOR APP

This is a pretty basic calculator made in C.

It supports only opearions between two operands.

The only operations allowed are +, -, *, / and ^.

A calculator that operates only two operands is very limitating though.
Because of that the first improvement I want to do is to make the calculator be able to operate multiple operands.

I upgraded the calculator using a dedicated function do calculate the operation.

Then slowly I will add more functions and I will optimize the app the more I can.

🙏🏻 Please keep in mind that I'm still a beginner and this is just me sharing my improvement and learning path.
